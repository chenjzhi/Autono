abstract: >
    This research proposes a lightweight autonomous agent framework based on the ReAct paradigm, designed to solve complex tasks through adaptive decision-making and multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on fixed workflows generated by an LLM-based scheduler, this framework dynamically generates next actions during agent execution based on prior trajectories, which enhances their robustness. To address potential termination issues caused by adaptive execution paths, I propose a timely abandonment strategy with a probabilistic penalty mechanism. For multi-agent collaboration, I introduce a memory transfer mechanism that enables shared and dynamically updated memory among agents. The framework's innovative timely abandonment strategy dynamically adjusts the probability of task abandonment via probabilistic penalties, allowing developers to balance conservative and exploratory tendencies in agent execution strategies by tuning hyperparameters. This significantly improves adaptability and task efficiency in complex environments. Additionally, agents can be expanded through external tool use, supported by modular design and MCP protocol compatibility for flexible action space expansion. Through explicit division of labor, the multi-agent collaboration mechanism enables agents to focus on specific task components, thereby significantly improving execution efficiency and quality.
